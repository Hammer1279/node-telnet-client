## Autorun command

Create a file called `batchrun.txt` in the same directory as the client, write each command on a separate line

## Installation

Just download the latest binary for your operating system from the releases page for the last stable version.
For experimental versions, check the pre-releases under releases, for "nightly" builds, check the actions for the latest build artifacts, they build for every commit.

## Run from Source

It has zero dependencies itself so to run a copy locally, just run it with `node index.js`

To build the application, run `npm install` and then `npm run build`.
